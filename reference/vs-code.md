# VS Code

Trunk is also available as a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trunk.io) that you can use to streamline your linting and formatting experiences.

### Get Started

By default, Trunk will try to automatically initialize itself in single-player mode. This means that it'll create a Trunk configuration that is hidden from git, which allows you to try it out [without Trunk's versioning powers](vs-code.md#single-player-mode).

If Trunk has not initialized itself in single-player mode, then you will need to initialize it manually, either by pressing the 'Initialize Trunk' button in the Trunk side panel:

![initialize trunk](https://static.trunk.io/assets/vscode\_init\_trunk.png)

or via the command line: just install the CLI and run `trunk init` in your repo.

* Install Trunk ‚Üí `curl https://get.trunk.io -fsSL | bash`
* Setup Trunk in your repo ‚Üí `trunk init`
* See and fix issues as you code in VSCode ‚Üí **You're in the right place üëç**

### Features

#### Discovery

Trunk will suggest tools that will supercharge your development, from `actionlint`, for your GitHub Actions, to`sql-formatter` and `sqlfluff` for your SQL, to`yamllint`, for your YAML files.

We believe that everything in your repository not only can be, but also should be, automatically formatted and automatically linted. We also recognize that a big part of this is making it easy for our users to discover tools that are newly applicable to them, so when Trunk is initialized, we turn on as much as we can, and then periodically follow up with suggestions for new tools.

#### Seamless user experience

On the side bar to the left you'll see the Trunk icon, which you can use to open the side panel to view issues. By default, issues are populated for every file you open as well as any modified files.

Trunk also shows Trunk Check Issues in a panel in the File Explorer, but you can hide it if you wish:

#### Single-player Mode

In single-player mode, Trunk creates a [configuration file](trunk-yaml/) and hides it from Git, so that you can test out Trunk on your own and get familiar with how it works, without committing this file.

Users normally check this file in to your repository so that you can run Trunk reproducibly: it pins the version of trunk, as well as that of every runtime and linter that you've enabled, allowing your team to guarantee that everyone and your CI runners are always running the exact same checks on your code.

To check it in to your repository, all you have to do is run

```bash
trunk config share
```

or click on the notification to "Share trunk config", which will commit `.trunk/trunk.yaml`, the Trunk configuration file.
