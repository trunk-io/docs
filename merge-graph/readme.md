  Trunk Merge Graph is a beta Merge Queue solution. The MergeGraph parallelizes
  testing of independent PRs, increasing throughput to your repository while
  maintaining the correctness of tests.

# Merge Graph

## Getting Started

Trunk Merge Graph is coming out of beta soon. For a sneak peek, please contact us at our [Slack](https://slack.trunk.io/), and we'll help get your repository set up!

## How it Works

We suggest reading our docs on the [merge queue](../merge/) for prior art. A merge graph is like a merge queue, but instead of testing with every upstream PR, it will only test PRs dependent on one another. PRs depend on one another if they share at least one [impacted target](impacted-targets.md).

When a PR is submitted to the merge graph, the graph will examine the provided list of impacted targets that result from code changes in a PR. The testing branch created only consists of other PRs that **transitively** share an edge with the PR. For example, if:

* PR 1 impacts `[src/protos/]`
* PR 2 impacts `[src/user_service/, src/protos/]`
* PR 3 impacts `[docs/]`,

a graph may look like:

but the queue will look like:
