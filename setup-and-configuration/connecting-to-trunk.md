# Connecting to Trunk

### Create a Trunk Account

Welcome to Trunk! Before you can access Trunk's toolkit to ship faster, you must [create a Trunk account](https://app.trunk.io/signup). You can connect to Trunk in two ways:

* Connect with OAuth using your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account.
* Connect with SSO through your organization's email. To configure SSO for your organization, please [contact us](mailto:support@trunk.io) or [join us on Slack](https://slack.trunk.io/).

### Create an Organization

After creating a Trunk Account, you'll be invited to [create an organization](https://app.trunk.io/onboarding). Organizations are shared workspaces for your team, and **individual repositories** connected to Trunk will fall under your team's organization.

To create your organization, you need the following:

* Workspace Name: This is the display name of your organization. This can be changed later.
* Workspace URL: This is the link to access your workspace and also your [Organization Slug](managing-your-organization/#slug). This cannot be changed.
* Users to Invite: Invite your team to your organization by email. You can[ invite and manage members](managing-your-organization/#inviting-team-members) later in your organization's settings.
