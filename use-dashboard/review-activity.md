Each completed investigation will show up in the activity feed, with additional details such as:

* The PR ID, creator, and a link to it
* The root-cause of the failure and a link to the PR comment left by the CI Autopilot
* If a fix PR was requested, a link to the stacked PR to fix the root-cause



### Filtering

You can filter the activity feed by the PR author using the dropdown menu on the top right.
