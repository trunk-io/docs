{% hint style="danger" %}
You must upload tests from both PR and [**stable branchs**](https://docs.trunk.io/flaky-tests/detection#stable-branches), such as `main`, `master`, or `develop` in CI for Trunk to detect flaky tests. Trunk will not detect flaky tests without uploads from both PR and stable branches.&#x20;
