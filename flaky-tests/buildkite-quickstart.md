# Buildkite Quickstart

### Getting Started

You can use the analytics test uploader within your Buildkite workflows to upload test your test results.

{% hint style="info" %}
The trunk analytics test uploader currently only supports Linux x64. If you have another use case, please get in touch with support at [https://slack.trunk.io](https://slack.trunk.io). For the best results, you'll need to validate that your test invocation doesn't use cached test results and doesn't automatically retry failing tests.
{% endhint %}

1. Create a Buildkite workflow that runs the tests you want to monitor. In order for us to use the results, these tests **must** produces a test report in [**JUnit XML**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/developer-for-zos/14.1?topic=formats-junit-xml-format) format.
2. Find your organization slug. First you'll need to navigate to [app.trunk.io](http://app.trunk.io). Once logged in, you will be automatically redirected to a URL similar to [https://app.trunk.io/**my-org-slug**/repo-owner/repo-name/ci-analytics](https://app.trunk.io/my-org-slug/repo-owner/repo-name/ci-analytics). 
3. Store your trunk token in a [secret](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/secrets) named `TRUNK_TOKEN`. You can find your Trunk token by navigating to Settings → Manage Organization → Organization API Token and clicking "View."
4. Update your Buildkite workflow to download and run the test uploader binary after you've run your tests:

### Sample Buildkite workflow steps:

```
steps:
  - label: "Run tests"
    command: echo "hello world"
    key: tests
  - label: "Upload test results"
    commands:
      - "curl -fsSL --retry 3 https://trunk.io/releases/analytics-cli/latest -o ./trunk-analytics-uploader"
      - "chmod +x ./trunk-analytics-uploader"
      - "./trunk-analytics-uploader upload --junit-paths *.xml --org-url-slug trunk --token $$TRUNK_TOKEN"
    key: upload
    depends_on:
       - tests
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The `trunk-analytics-uploader` binary should be run from the repository root. If you need to run the binary from another location, you must provide the path to the repo root using the `--repo-root`argument.
The `--junit-paths` argument accepts the xml file locations as both a list of globs or absolute paths.
{% endhint %}
