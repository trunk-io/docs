# Jasmine

Jasmine is a testing framework for Javascript and Typescript.

### Enabling XML Output

Configure Jasmine to produce [JUnit XML](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml) output.&#x20;

Install the [`jasmine-reporters`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-reporters) package

```shell
npm install --save-dev jasmine-reporters
```

Create an instance of a JUnitXMLReporter to the top of your test file and add it to your Jasmine environment.

```javascript
import reporters from "jasmine-reporters";

var junitReporter = new reporters.JUnitXmlReporter({
  savePath: "tests/jasmine/reports",
  consolidateAll: false,
});
jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(junitReporter);

describe("HuntingSeason", () => {
  it("Bugs - `Duck Season`", () => {
    const season = new Season();
    expect(season.getCurrent()).toEqual("Duck");
  });

  it("Daffy - `Rabbit Season`", () => {
    const season = new Season();
    expect(season.getCurrent()).toEqual("Rabbit");
  });
});
```

With this configuration, Jasmine will output an xml file in the `tests/jasmine/reports` directory.

### Test Suite Naming

Jasmine will use the test suite names for the file name and xml attributes by combining them with the `JUnitXmlReporter` settings. For example with the `savePath` set to `"tests/jasmine/reports"` the test suite named `"HuntingSeason"` will output to the file `"tests/jasmine/reports/junitresults-HuntingSeason.xml".`

The names of the test suites can be modified by providing a `modifySuiteName()` function. See [the official docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-reporters#multi-capabilities) for details.

Unfortunately this reporter does not support adding the `file` attribute to the XML.

### Further Information

See an example of running Jasmine inside of a GitHub action [here](https://github.com/trunk-io/flake-factory/blob/main/.github/workflows/javascript-tests.yaml#L56).
