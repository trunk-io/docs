Cargo-nextest is a testing framework for Rust.

## Enabling XML Output
Rust has built in support for unit tests using `cargo test`.  Unfortunately `cargo test` does not support customizing output formats (though there is [experimental support for JSON output](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/test/enum.OutputFormat.html)). Instead we suggest using **cargo-nextest.**

[cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/) is an alternative test runner for Rust which, among other cool features, supports XML and JSON output. Install **cargo-nextest** as either a [pre-built binary](https://nexte.st/book/installation) like this:

```shell
curl -LsSf https://get.nexte.st/latest/linux | tar zxf - -C ${CARGO_HOME:-~/.cargo}/bin
```
or [install and compile](https://nexte.st/book/installing-from-source) from source.



Next add a `.config/nextest.toml`  config file to tell **cargo-nextest** what output format to use and where the output should be written too, among other settings. Something like this:

```toml
[store]
dir = "target/nextest"

# This section defines the default nextest profile. Custom profiles are layered
# on top of the default profile.
[profile.default]
retries = 0
test-threads = "num-cpus"
threads-required = 1
status-level = "pass"
final-status-level = "flaky"
failure-output = "immediate"
success-output = "never"
fail-fast = true
slow-timeout = { period = "60s" }

[profile.ci]
fail-fast = false

[profile.ci.junit]
path = "junit.xml"

report-name = "nextest-run"
store-success-output = false
store-failure-output = true
```
The **default** profile will use standard text output. The **ci** profile will use JUnit XML output.

Now run the tests with: 

```undefined
cargo nextest run --profile=ci
```


## Test Suite Naming

You can change the name of the report with the `report-name` option.  Nextest will use the test binary names for the `<testsuite>` and the individual test names for the `<testcase>`. However, Nextest does not currently support adding the filepaths and names.



## Further Information
See an example of **cargo-nextest** invoked form a GitHub action [here](https://github.com/trunk-io/flake-factory/blob/main/.github/workflows/rust-tests.yaml).
