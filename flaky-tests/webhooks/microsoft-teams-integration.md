# Microsoft Teams Integration

Trunk allows you to create custom workflows to send customized messages to Microsoft Teams channels through webhooks.&#x20;

This guide will walk you through sending Microsoft Teams messages using event-triggered webhooks. By the end of this tutorial, you'll receive Microsoft Teams messages for test status changes. This guide should take 10 minutes to complete.

### 1. Configure Incoming Webhooks For Your Team

Microsoft has two different concepts for accepting incoming webhooks. **Connectors** that are being deprecated and **Workflows** that are for newly created teams. This guide is for the newer **Workflows**. The workflow for configuring webhooks is similar, but you may see small differences. You can find more about the soon to be deprecated connectors in [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet).

1. Open the team in which you want to add the webhook and select the kebab menu (•••) from the upper-right corner.
2. Select **Workflows** from the dropdown menu.
3. Search for `Post to a channel when a webhook request is received`, select the workflow, then click **Next**.&#x20;
4. Configure the workflow's **Microsoft Teams Team** and **Microsoft Teams Channel**, then click **Add workflow**.&#x20;
5. When the workflow is added correctly, you can copy the URL displayed, then click **Done.**

### 2. Add a New Webhook

Trunk uses Svix to integrate with other services, such as Microsoft Teams messages through webhooks.&#x20;

You can create a new endpoint by:

1. Login to [Trunk Flaky Tests](https://app.trunk.io/login/?intent=flaky+tests)
2. From your profile on the top right, navigate to **Settings**
3.  Under **Organization > Webhooks**, click **Teams**

4. Paste your Microsoft Teams Workflow URL from [the previous step ](microsoft-teams-integration.md#id-1.-configure-incoming-webhooks-for-your-team)into **Endpoint URL**.
5. Review the transformation code automatically generated for Teams messages. You can customize this transformation at any time. Learn more about [customizing transformations](microsoft-teams-integration.md#id-3.-customize-your-transformation).
6. Create the new endpoint. You will be redirected to the endpoint configuration view.

### 3. Customize Your Transformation

Transformations are custom code snippets you can write to customize the Microsoft Teams messages created by the webhook. A working template transformation will be added automatically for your webhook, but you can further customize the behavior of this webhook.

1. In the endpoint configuration view, navigate to the **Advanced** tab. Under **Transformation**, toggle the **Enabled** switch.
2. Click **Edit transformation** to update your transformation code, and click **Save** to update the transformation.
3. You can test the transformation by selecting the `test_case.status_changed` payload and clicking **Run Test**. This will test the transformation but not send a message. You will learn to send a test message in [step 4](microsoft-teams-integration.md#id-4.-test-your-webhook).

Below is an example of a webhook transformation to format the messages as [Actionable Messages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using?tabs=cURL%2Ctext1). If you're having trouble adding a new webhook endpoint with Svix, please see the [Adding Endpoint docs from Svix](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/using-app-portal/adding-endpoints).

            }

    };
}
```

### 4. Test Your Webhook

You can send test messages to your Microsoft Teams channels as you make updates. You can do this by:

1. In the endpoint configuration view, navigate to the **Testing** tab and select a **Send event**
2. Under **Subscribed events,** select `test_case.status_changed`as the event type to send.
3. Click **Send Example** to test your webhook

### 5. Monitoring Webhooks

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/monitoring-webhooks (1).md" %}

### Congratulations!

You should now receive notifications in your Teams channel when a test's status changes. You can further modify your transformation script to customize your messages.&#x20;
