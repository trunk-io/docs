description: Use webhooks to automate custom flaky test workflows

# Webhooks

Trunk provides webhooks for you to build custom integrations to automate workflows, like notifying your team when a test becomes flaky or automatically creating tickets to investigate flaky tests. Trunk already provides a Jira integration, and more are planned. Webhooks lets you build custom integrations for use cases that are not supported out of the box.

[Svix](https://docs.svix.com/) powers webhooks for Trunk. You'll be using Svix to configure webhooks and you should familiarize yourself with the [Svix App Portal docs](https://docs.svix.com/app-portal) to learn more.

### Supported Events

Trunk lets you create custom workflows with **event-triggered webhooks**. Flaky Test events are named with a `test_case` prefix. You can find all the events that Trunk supports in the event catalog:
