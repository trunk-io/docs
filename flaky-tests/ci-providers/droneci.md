description: Configure Flaky Tests using Drone CI

# Drone CI

## Getting Started

You can use the Flaky Tests CLI within your [Drone CI](https://www.drone.io/) pipelines to upload and analyze your test results.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Trunk Flaky Tests CLI currently only supports x86_64 and arm64 for both Linux and macOS. If you have another use case, please get in touch with support in our [community Slack](https://slack.trunk.io/). For the best results, you'll need to validate that your test invocation does not use cached test results and does not automatically retry failing tests.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Drone CI Pipeline

Create a Drone CI pipeline (or modify an existing one) to run the tests that you want to monitor. The pipeline should produce a test report in [**JUnit XML**](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml) format. Most testing frameworks support XML output. See [Testing Framework Configuration](../frameworks/readme.md) for guides for common testing frameworks. Make sure that your test invocation doesn't use cached test results, and doesn't automatically retry failing tests.

### Find Organization Slug and Token

Next you will need your Trunk **organization slug** and **token.** Navigate to [app.trunk.io](http://app.trunk.io). Once logged in navigate to **Settings -> Manage -> Organization**. Copy your organization slug. You can find your Trunk token by navigating to **Settings → Manage Organization → Organization API** Token and clicking "View." Copy this token. Make sure you are getting your _organization token_, not your project/repo token.

### Set Project Environment Variables

In your Drone CI project settings create new variables for your Trunk org as `TRUNK_ORG_SLUG` and the API token as `TRUNK_API_TOKEN`.

### Add Uploader to Testing Pipeline

Now update your Drone CI pipeline to download and run the Trunk Uploader binary after you've run your tests. Below is an example of a NodeJS project using Vitest tests. It accepts environment variables from a secret file for local testing. In your project configure it to accept the variables using your preferred method.

You can upload test results to Flaky Tests with the [`trunk-analytics-cli`](https://github.com/trunk-io/analytics-cli) by running
it in a stage after your tests are complete. There are four different OS/arch builds of the CLI in the latest release. Pick the
one you need for your testing platform and be sure to download the release on every CI run. **Do not bake the CLI into a
container or VM.** This ensures your CI runs are always using the latest build.

In the config about we have added two additional commands to download the latest release of the `trunk-analytics-cli` and
then run it to upload the test output XML file. The `TRUNK\_ORG\_SLUG` and `TRUNK\_API\_TOKEN` variables are filled in at runtime by
the Drone CI environment variables set earlier.
