description: Configure Flaky Tests using GitLab CI
---

# GitLab

## Getting Started

You can use the analytics test uploader within your [GitLab Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/) to upload your test results.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Trunk Flaky Tests Uploader currently only supports Linux x64 and macOS for Intel and Arm. If you have another use case, please get in touch with support at [https://slack.trunk.io](https://slack.trunk.io/). For the best results, you'll need to validate that your test invocation doesn't use cached test results and doesn't automatically retry failing tests.
{% endhint %}

### Create workflow

Create a GitLab pipeline that runs the tests you want to monitor. In order for us to use the results, these tests **must** produces a test report in [**JUnit XML**](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml) format.

## Find Organization Slug and Token

Next you will need your Trunk **organization slug** and **token.** Navigate to [app.trunk.io](http://app.trunk.io). Once logged in navigate to **Settings** -> **Manage** -> **Organization**.  Copy your organization slug. You can find your Trunk token by navigating to **Settings** → **Manage Organization** → **Organization API Token** and clicking "View."  Copy this token.

### Create GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Variables

[Create a GitLab Variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/index.html#for-a-project) for your `TRUNK_API_TOKEN` by navigating to your GitLab project's **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **Variables**. You will use this variable in the next steps to upload test results to Flaky Tests.

### Add Uploader to Testing Workflow

You can upload test results to Flaky Tests with
the [`trunk-analytics-uploader`](https://github.com/trunk-io/analytics-uploader) by running it in a stage after
your tests are complete. There are five different OS/arch builds of the uploader in the latest release.
Pick the one you need for your testing platform and be sure to download the release on every CI run.
**Do not bake the CLI into a container or VM.** This ensures your CI runs are always using the latest build.

The `trunk-analytics-uploader` tool has several important arguments;

* `--junit-paths`is a comma separated list of paths.
* `--org-url-slug` is an identifier for the Trunk account you are using. This is the Organization Slug you copied from your Trunk settings above set as a GitLab Variable.
* `--token` is the Trunk API token you added as a GitLab Variable above.
