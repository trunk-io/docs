#### Discovering Tools

The trunk [plugins](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins) repo ships with a collection of tools that can help supercharge your repository and provide examples for how to write your own. To see a list of tools that you can enable in your own repo run:

```shell
trunk tools list
```

#### Running Tools

`Trunk` installs your enabled tools into the `.trunk/tools` directory. Each tool exposes as list of **shims** (these may or may not be identically named to the tool - most typically a tool has one shim matching the name of the tool). Each shim is installed into the `.trunk/tools` directory.

You can run your tools by referring to the path `<path to your workspace>/.trunk/tools/<shim name>` but this is unwieldy. We highly recommend using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) in your repository and adding the following line to your `.envrc`:

```
PATH_add .trunk/tools
```

This way, whenever you're inside your repo at the command line, you can just run shims installed by `trunk tools` directly by name.
