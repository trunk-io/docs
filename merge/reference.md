## Submitting and Cancelling Pull Requests

We offer a few mechanisms for submitting a PR for to the Merge Graph:

* Posting a GitHub comment `/trunk merge` on a pull request.
* Ticking the checkbox in the Trunk comment on a pull request.
* Clicking the "Retry" button on the WebApp.
* Using the `trunk` CLI:

```

```

We offer similar commands for cancellation.

## PR States

A PR's lifecycle in the Merge Graph goes through the following states:

| State           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not Ready       | The PR was submitted to Trunk Merge, but the PR isn't eligible for merging yet. Impacted targets may not be uploaded, or readiness checks may not have passed.                                 |
| Pending         | The MergeGraph created a node for the PR. Testing will begin if the graph has capacity.                                                                                                        |
| Testing         | The PR is testing. Required tests are defined in `trunk.yaml.`                                                                                                                                 |
| Tests Passed    | The PR successfully passed tests. It may have to wait for upstream PRs to complete tests before merging.                                                                                       |
| Pending Failure | The PR failed tests. The cause of failures is still indeterminate - it may be due to an upstream PR, or due to the current PR. It will wait until the root cause of tests has been determined. |
| Merged          | The PR successfully merged into the target branch. It will be removed from the graph.                                                                                                          |
| Failed          | The PR caused a testing failure. It will be removed from the graph.                                                                                                                            |
| Cancelled       | The PR was cancelled, e.g. `/trunk cancel`. It will be removed from the graph.                                                                                                                 |
