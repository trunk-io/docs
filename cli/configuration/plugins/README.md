# Plugins

### Plugin Config Merging

Trunk uses a plugin system where a root configuration is defined in the [trunk-io/plugin repository](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins). You can import many plugin config sources, and fields defined at each level override the level above.

{% hint style="info" %}
When plugins configs are merged, only fields defined in a config file are merged into the level above. You can define just the fields you wish to override in `.trunk/trunk.yaml and .trunk/user.yaml.`
{% endhint %}

When using trunk, you can merge several sets of configuration files with a `trunk.yaml` schema. Config merging proceeds as follows:

1. Remote plugins sourced in `.trunk/trunk.yaml` (and `.trunk/user.yaml`). Plugins are sourced in the order they're defined, with later plugins overriding those defined before it. The [`trunk`](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins) plugin is implicitly sourced first.
2. Your repo level `.trunk/trunk.yaml` file, complete with a CLI version and any definitions or enables. Configurations defined here overrides what's defined in the remote plugins.
3. Optionally, `.trunk/user.yaml`, a local **git-ignored** file where users can provide their own overrides.

Additionally, any files enumerated in the lint `exported_configs` section are symlinked from their relevant plugin into the root of the workspace when an applicable linter is run with `trunk check`.

### Importing a Plugin Repository

By default trunk imports the trunk-io/plugins repository. To import a repo add it to the `plugins.sources` list. Each repo requires a URI and ref.

```yaml
plugins:
  sources:
    - id: trunk
      uri: https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins
      ref: v1.2.6
```

<table><thead><tr><th width="174">Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>id</code></td><td>unique identifier for this repository</td></tr><tr><td><code>uri</code></td><td>address used to clone the target repository</td></tr><tr><td><code>ref</code></td><td>commit id or tag to checkout. <strong>Do not use branch names, as these can be unstable</strong></td></tr><tr><td><code>local</code></td><td>path to local (on-disk) repository. Takes precedence over uri/ref if defined</td></tr><tr><td><code>import_to_global</code> (default: <code>true</code>)</td><td>import content into the global namespace. If set to false actions and linters defined in the plugin must be referenced by <code>&#x3C;plugin_id>.&#x3C;name></code></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Plugin Capabilities

Any configuration used in `trunk.yaml` can also be used in a plugin repository, with [some exceptions](./#excluded-fields). A plugin repository must have one root level `plugin.yaml` and can have any number of other `plugin.yaml` files in other subdirectories. These configuration files are then merged into one composite plugin configuration.

The most common use for a plugin repository is to define custom linters, actions, or tools. But they can also be used to define a common set of shared tools across an organization. For more info, see [organization configs](external-repositories.md).

The root `plugin.yaml` file may also have a `required_trunk_version` field which governs compatibility when [upgrading](../../upgrades.md) between CLI versions.

#### Add a plugin to your `trunk.yaml` file

To add a plugin from GitHub:

```
trunk plugins add https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins --id=trunk
```

To add a plugin from GitHub at a specific version:

```
trunk plugins add https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins v1.2.6 --id=trunk
```

To add a plugin from a local repository:

```
trunk plugins add /home/user/self/hello-world --id=hello-world
```

Note that when specifying a remote plugin, the `ref` field must be a tag or SHA.

### Plugins Scope

Plugins are merged serially, in the order that they are sourced, and can override almost any Trunk\
configuration. This allows organizations to provide a set of overrides and definitions in one\
central place.

For instance, you can create your own `my-plugins` repository with `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 0.1
lint:
  definitions:
    - name: trufflehog
      commands:
        - name: lint
          # override trufflehog to use '--only-verified'
          run: trufflehog filesystem --json --fail --only-verified ${target}
  enabled:
    - ruff@0.0.256
```

sourced in a `.trunk/trunk.yaml` file from another repository as follows:

```yaml
version: 0.1
plugins:
  sources:
    - id: trunk
      uri: https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins
      ref: v1.2.6
    - id: my-plugins
      local: ../my-plugins
```

When a user runs `trunk` in the sourcing repository, they will already have `ruff` enabled, along with the `trufflehog` override from the `my-plugins` repository.

Note that private GitHub plugin repositories are not currently supported.

### Excluded Fields

Plugin `sources`, as well as the `cli` `version`, are not merged from plugin repositories to ensure\
that config merging occurs in a predictable, stable fashion.
