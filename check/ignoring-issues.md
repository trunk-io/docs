# Ignoring Issues

\[block:callout] { "type": "info", "body": "If you're only looking to ignore issues in a single file, read on. If you want to ignore issues across multiple files, you probably want the docs for [`lint.ignore`](./configuration.md#ignoring-files) in `.trunk/trunk.yaml` (note that Check also ignores issues in `gitignore`-d files)." } \[/block] Sometimes we want to deliberately tell a linter that, yes, I know what I'm doing, and yes, in any other situation I should _not_ do this, but in this specific case it's fine. Maybe there's a dummy private key you're using for a test stack, or fixing the lint issue will actually make your code less readable: whatever it is, you now need to figure out how to suppress a given lint issue.

`trunk` provides a simple, standardized mechanism to do this, saving you from having to look up the linter-specific syntax for doing so:

```cpp
struct FooBar {
  // trunk-ignore(clang-tidy/modernize-use-nullptr): load-bearing NULL, see ISSUE-832
  void *ptr = NULL;
};
```

This tells `trunk` that the `clang-tidy` linter found a `modernize-use-nullptr` issue on the highlighted line and that `trunk` should suppress this linter issue.

Comments may be omitted:

```cpp
struct FooBar {
  // trunk-ignore(clang-tidy/modernize-use-nullptr)
  void *ptr = NULL;
};
```

You can also omit the name of the check to simply tell `trunk` that all issues from a given linter on a specific line should be suppressed:

```cpp
struct FooBar {
  // trunk-ignore(clang-tidy)
  void *ptr = NULL;
};
```

`trunk-ignore` directives can also be placed at the end of the line on which they're suppressing lint issues:

```cpp
struct FooBar {
  void *ptr1 = NULL;  // trunk-ignore(clang-tidy/modernize-use-nullptr)
  void *ptr2 = NULL;  // trunk-ignore(clang-tidy)
};
```

If you need to suppress issues from multiple linters, `trunk-ignore` supports that too:

```cpp
struct FooBar {
  // trunk-ignore(clang-tidy): ISSUE-914 explains why the `void *` type is needed
  // trunk-ignore(gitleaks,my-custom-linter/do-not-hardcode-passwords): see ISSUE-915
  void *super_secret_password = (void *)("915dr~S$Pzqod~oR*CrQ$/SQ@hbtQBked:CL@z!y]");
};
```

Notice that a `trunk-ignore` directive applies not to the next line, but the next non-`trunk-ignore` line (this only works for _preceding_ directives, not _trailing_ directives), and that you can use a single directive for suppressing multiple checks.

#### Ignoring all issues in a file

You can also ignore all issues in a file:

```cpp
// trunk-ignore-all(clang-tidy)
struct FooBar {
  void *ptr1 = NULL;
  void *ptr2 = NULL;
};
```

\[block:callout] { "type": "info", "body": " `trunk-ignore-all` is not required to be the first line of a file, because we recognize that other constructs (shebangs, front matter, docstrings) may need to take precedence." } \[/block]

#### Ignoring all issues in a code block

Alternatively, you can ignore all matching issues in a code block:

```cpp
struct FooBar {
  // trunk-ignore-begin(clang-tidy)
  void *ptr1 = NULL;
  void *ptr2 = NULL;
  // trunk-ignore-end(clang-tidy)
};
```

### Specification

The syntax of a trunk-ignore directive is as follows:

```
<trunk-ignore>      ::= <trunk-ignore-type> "(" <check-ids> ")" <optional-comment>
<trunk-ignore-type> ::= "trunk-ignore" | "trunk-ignore-begin" | "trunk-ignore-end" | "trunk-ignore-all"
<check-ids>         ::= <check-id> <optional-check-id>
<optional-check-id> ::= "," <check-id>
<check-id>          ::= <linter-id> <optional-rule-id>
<optional-rule-id>  ::= "/" <rule-id>
<optional-comment>  ::= ": " <comment>
```

### Known Issues

`trunk-ignore` does not currently support:

* suppressing findings on lines 0 or 1 using inline/block directives

If you need any of these to be supported, or you have another edge case, please reach out to us on the [Trunk community slack](https://slack.trunk.io).
