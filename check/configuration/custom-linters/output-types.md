description: Custom Linters should output one of several output formats.

# Output

# Output Sources

The output format that Trunk expects from a linter is determined by its [`output`](./#output) type.

**`stdout`, `stderr` or `tmp_file`**

`trunk` generally expects a linter to output its findings to `stdout`, but does support other output mechanisms:

| `read_output_from` | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stdout`           | Standard output.                                                                  |
| `stderr`           | Standard error.                                                                   |
| `tmp_file`         | If `${tmpfile}` was specified in `command`, the path of the created `${tmpfile}`. |

# Output Types

Trunk supports several different generic output types. Most linters will use one of these output types, but if your linter doesn't conform well to any of these specifications, you can also write a [custom parser](custom-parsers.md). In general SARIF should be preferred over other formats because it is the most
flexible and battle tested.

## SARIF

`output: sarif` linters produce diagnostics in the [Static Analysis Results Interchange Format](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.0/sarif-v2.0.html):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/master/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "runs": [
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "level": "warning",
          "locations": [
            {
              "physicalLocation": {
                "artifactLocation": {
                  "uri": "/dev/shm/sandbox/detekt_test_repo/example.kt"
                },
                "region": {
                  "startColumn": 12,
                  "startLine": 18
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "message": {
            "text": "A class should always override hashCode when overriding equals and the other way around."
          },
          "ruleId": "detekt.potential-bugs.EqualsWithHashCodeExist"
        }
      ],
      "tool": {
        "driver": {
          "downloadUri": "https://github.com/detekt/detekt/releases/download/v1.19.0/detekt",
          "fullName": "detekt",
          "guid": "022ca8c2-f6a2-4c95-b107-bb72c43263f3",
          "informationUri": "https://detekt.github.io/detekt",
          "language": "en",
          "name": "detekt",
          "organization": "detekt",
          "semanticVersion": "1.19.0",
          "version": "1.19.0"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## LSP JSON

`output: lsp_json` linters output issues as [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#diagnostic) JSON.

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Not formatted correctly. Missing owner",
    "code": "missing-owner",
    "severity": "Error",
    "range": {
      "start": {
        "line": 12,
        "character": 8
      },
      "end": {
        "line": 12,
        "character": 12
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "message": "TODO is assigned to someone not listed in this project",
    "code": "unknown-user",
    "severity": "Warning",
    "range": {
      "start": {
        "line": 37,
        "character": 0
      },
      "end": {
        "line": 37,
        "character": 14
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Pass/Fail Linters

`output: pass_fail` linters find either:

* no issues in a file, indicated by exiting with `exit_code=0`, or
* a single file-level issue in a file, whose message is the linter's `stdout`, indicated by exiting\
  with `exit_code=1`.

> Note: Exiting with `exit_code=1` but writing nothing to `stdout` is considered to be a linter tool failure.
>
> Note: `pass_fail` linters are required to have `success_codes: [0, 1]`

## Regex

`output: regex` linters produce output that can be parsed with custom regular expressions and named capture groups. The regular expression is specified in the `parse_regex` field.

`regex` supports capturing strings from a linter output for the following named capture groups:

* `path`: file path (required)
* `line`: line number
* `col`: column number
* `severity`: one of `allow`, `deny`, `disabled`, `error`, `info`, `warning`
* `code`: linter diagnostic code
* `message`: description

For example, the output

```
.trunk/trunk.yaml:7:81: [error] line too long (82 > 80 characters) (line-length)
```

can be parsed with the regular expression

```
((?P<path>.*):(?P<line>\d+):(?P<col>\d+): \[(?P<severity>.*)\] (?P<message>.*) \((?P<code>.*)\))
```

and would result in a `trunk` diagnostic that looks like this:

```
7:81  high    line too long (82 > 80 characters)      regex-linter/line-length
```

In the event that multiple capture groups of the same name are specified, the nonempty capture will be preferred. If there are multiple non-empty captures, a linter error will be thrown. Adjust your regular expression accordingly to match the specifics of your output.

> Note: For additional information on building custom regular expressions, see [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). More complicated regex may require additional escape characters in yaml configuration.

## Arcanist

You can also output JSON using the Arcanist format.

```json
[
  {
    "Char": 1,
    "Code": "missing_copyright",
    "Description": "Message about things\nMaybe contain multiple lines and web\nlinks\nhttps://website.com/notice-about-stuff\n",
    "Line": 1,
    "Name": "Incorrect (or missing) copyright notice",
    "OriginalText": "",
    "Path": "somefile.py"
  }
]
```

## Formatters

`output: rewrite` linters write the formatted version of a file to `stdout`; this becomes an autofix which `trunk` can prompt you to apply (which is what `trunk check` does by default) or automatically apply for you (if you `trunk check --fix` or `trunk fmt`).

For example, if you wanted a linter to normalize your line endings, you could do this:

```yaml
lint:
  definitions:
    - name: no-carriage-returns
      files: [ALL]
      commands:
        - output: rewrite
          formatter: true
          command: sed s/\r// ${target}
          success_codes: [0]
```

Setting `formatter: true` will cause `trunk fmt` to run this linter.
