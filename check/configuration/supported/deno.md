**deno** is a linter for Javascript, JSON, TypeScript and Markdown.

You can enable the deno plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable deno
```

# Settings

deno uses the same config files as the
upstream [deno](https://deno.land/manual) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `deno.json`, `deno.jsonc`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/deno) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
