# gofmt

**gofmt** is a linter for Go.

You can enable the gofmt plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable gofmt
```

## Settings



Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/gofmt) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
