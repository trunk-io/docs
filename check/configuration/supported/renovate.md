**renovate** is a linter for Renovate.

You can enable the renovate plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable renovate
```

# Settings

renovate uses the same config files as the
upstream [renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `renovate.json`, `renovate.json5`, `.github/renovate.json`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/renovate) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
