**remark-lint** is a linter for Markdown.

You can enable the remark-lint plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable remark-lint
```

# Settings

remark-lint uses the same config files as the
upstream [remark-lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `.remarkrc`, `.remarkrc.json`, `.remarkrc.cjs`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/remark-lint) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
