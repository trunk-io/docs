**gofumpt** is a linter for Go.

You can enable the gofumpt plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable gofumpt
```

# Settings


Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/gofumpt) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
