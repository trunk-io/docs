# Terraform

[**Terraform**](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands) is a formatter for Terraform.

You can enable the Terraform formatter with:

```shell
trunk check enable terraform
```

## Auto Enabling

Terraform will never be auto-enabled. It must be enabled manually.



## Usage Notes

We currently support `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt`, but only `fmt` is enabled by default when you add `terraform` to your enabled list in `trunk.yaml`. To enable `validate`, add this to your `trunk.yaml`:

```yaml
lint:
  enabled:
    - terraform@<version>:
        commands: [validate, fmt]
```
Note: you must run `terraform init` before running `trunk check` with `terraform validate` enabled (both locally, or on CI).
