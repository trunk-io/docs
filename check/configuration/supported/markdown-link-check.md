**markdown-link-check** is a linter for Markdown.

You can enable the markdown-link-check plugin with

```

# Settings


Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/markdown-link-check) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
