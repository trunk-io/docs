# pre-commit-hooks

**pre-commit-hooks** is a linter for All.

You can enable the pre-commit-hooks plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable pre-commit-hooks
```

## Settings



Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/pre-commit-hooks) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
