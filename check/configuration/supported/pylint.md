# Pylint

[**Pylint**](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) is a linter for Python.

You can enable the Pylint linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable pylint
```

## Auto Enabling

Pylint will be auto-enabled if any of its config files are present: *`pylintrc`, `.pylintrc`*.

## Settings

Pylint supports the following config files:
* `pylintrc`
* `.pylintrc`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linter Configs](..#moving-linter-configs) for more info.


## Usage Notes

You may specify additional pylint plugins in your `.pylintrc`, using the line `load-plugins=...`

If you want to run the plugin `pylint-django` as part of your setup, you would add the line `load-plugins=pylint_django` to your `.pylintrc`, but you **also** need to tell trunk to install the package:

```yaml
- pylint@2.11.0:
    packages:
      - pylint-django@2.4.4

```
