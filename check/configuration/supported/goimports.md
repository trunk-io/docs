**goimports** is a linter for Go.

You can enable the goimports plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable goimports
```

# Settings


Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/goimports) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
