# SQLFluff

[**SQLFluff**](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) is a linter for SQL.

You can enable the SQLFluff linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable sqlfluff
```

## Auto Enabling

SQLFluff will be auto-enabled if a `.sqlfluff` config file is present.

## Settings

SQLFluff supports the following config files:
* `.sqlfluff`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linter Configs](..#moving-linter-configs) for more info.
Trunk check provides a default `.sqlfluff` if your project does not already have one.

## Usage Notes

Sqlfluff is only configured as a linter by default because its formatting capabilities are limited. To turn sqlfluff formatting on, enable its subcommand:

```yaml
lint:
  enabled:
    - sqlfluff@<version>:
      commands: [lint, fix]
```
