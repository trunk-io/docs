**standardrb** is a linter for Ruby.

You can enable the standardrb plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable standardrb
```

# Settings

standardrb uses the same config files as the
upstream [standardrb](https://github.com/testdouble/standard#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `.standard.yml`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/standardrb) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
