# git-diff-check

**git-diff-check** is a linter for All.

You can enable the git-diff-check plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable git-diff-check
```

## Settings



Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/git-diff-check) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
