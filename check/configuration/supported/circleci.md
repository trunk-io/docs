**circleci** is a linter for CircleCI Config.

You can enable the circleci plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable circleci
```

# Settings


Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/circleci) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
