# Gitleaks 

Gitleaks  is a linter for All.

You can enable the Gitleaks  plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable gitleaks
```

# Settings

Gitleaks  uses the same config files as the 
upstream [Gitleaks ](https://gitleaks.io/) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `.gitleaks.config`, `.gitleaks.toml`, `.gitleaksignore`).

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/gitleaks) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
Gitleaks v7 only works with Go 1.16, not Go 1.18 while Gitleaks v8 works with 1.18. We recommend using v8, but if you specifically need to use v7 you can override the go runtime version like so:

```yaml
yaruntimes:
  enabled:
    - go@1.16.7
```
Again, this is not recommended. Just use Gitleaks v8 or later with go 1.18 or later.
