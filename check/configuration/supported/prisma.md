# prisma

**prisma** is a linter for Prisma.

You can enable the prisma plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable prisma
```

## Settings



Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/prisma) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
