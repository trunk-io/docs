**yapf** is a linter for Python.

You can enable the yapf plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable yapf
```

# Settings

yapf uses the same config files as the
upstream [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `.style.yapf`, `.yapfignore`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/yapf) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
