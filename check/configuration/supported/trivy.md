# Trivy

[**Trivy**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is a linter for Security.

You can enable the Trivy linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable trivy
```

## Auto Enabling

Trivy will be auto-enabled if any *Lockfile, ALL, Docker, Yaml or Terraform* files are present.

## Settings

Trivy supports the following config files:
* `trivy-secret.yaml`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linter Configs](..#moving-linter-configs) for more info.


## Usage Notes



Trivy has the following subcommands:

* `config`

* Runs `trivy config` ([docs) ](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/scanner/misconfiguration/))to scan for misconfigurations in infrastructure-as-code files. Enabled by default

* `fx-vuln`

* Runs `trivy fs --scanners vuln `([docs](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/target/filesystem/)) to scan for  security vulnerabilities. Disabled by default.

* `fs-secret`

* Runs `trivy fs --scanners secret `  ([docs](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/target/filesystem/)) to scan for secrets. Disabled by default.

To enable/disable these, add the subcommands you want enabled in your `.trunk/trunk.yaml` as such:

```yaml
lint:
  enabled:
    - trivy@0.45.1:
        commands: [config, fs-vuln]
```
