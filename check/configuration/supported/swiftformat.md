**swiftformat** is a linter for Swift.

You can enable the swiftformat plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable swiftformat
```

# Settings

swiftformat uses the same config files as the
upstream [swiftformat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `.swiftformat`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/swiftformat) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
