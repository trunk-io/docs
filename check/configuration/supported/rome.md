**rome** is a linter for Javascript and TypeScript.

You can enable the rome plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable rome
```

# Settings

rome uses the same config files as the
upstream [rome](https://github.com/rome/tools#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `rome.json`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/rome) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
