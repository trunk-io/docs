**rufo** is a linter for Ruby.

You can enable the rufo plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable rufo
```

# Settings

rufo uses the same config files as the
upstream [rufo](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `.rufo`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/rufo) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
