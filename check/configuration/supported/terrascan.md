# terrascan

**terrascan** is a linter for Terrascan, Security and Terraform.

You can enable the terrascan plugin with

```

## Settings



Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/terrascan) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
