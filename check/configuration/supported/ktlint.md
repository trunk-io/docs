**ktlint** is a linter for Kotlin.

You can enable the ktlint plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable ktlint
```

# Settings


Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/ktlint) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
