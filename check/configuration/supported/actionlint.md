# Actionlint

[**Actionlint**](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) is a linter for GitHub.

You can enable the Actionlint linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable actionlint
```

## Auto Enabling

Actionlint will be auto-enabled if any *Github-workflow* files are present.

## Settings

Actionlint supports the following config files:
* `.github/actionlint.yaml`
* `.github/actionlint.yml`

Unlike with most tools under `trunk check`, these files cannot be moved.
