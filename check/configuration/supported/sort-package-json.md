**sort-package-json** is a linter for package.json.

You can enable the sort-package-json plugin with

```shell

```

# Settings


Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/sort-package-json) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
