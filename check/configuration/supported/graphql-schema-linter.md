**graphql-schema-linter** is a linter for GraphQL.

You can enable the graphql-schema-linter plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable graphql-schema-linter
```

# Settings

graphql-schema-linter uses the same config files as the
upstream [graphql-schema-linter](https://github.com/cjoudrey/graphql-schema-linter#readme) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `.graphql-schema-linter.config.js`, `.graphql-schema-linterrc`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/graphql-schema-linter) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
