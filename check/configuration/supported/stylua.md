**stylua** is a linter for Lua.

You can enable the stylua plugin with

```shell
trunk check enable stylua
```

# Settings

stylua uses the same config files as the
upstream [stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua/tree/main) project, so you can continue to use any
existing configuration files (ex: `stylua.toml`, `.stylua.toml`).
    

Trunk provides a [default configuration](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main/linters/stylua) if your project does not already have one,
which you can see in our [open source plugins repo](https://github.com/trunk-io/plugins/tree/main).
