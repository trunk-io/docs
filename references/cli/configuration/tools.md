# Tools

Tool definitions

Each tool definition shares a set of attributes:

<table><thead><tr><th width="237">Field</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>name</code></td><td>The name of the tool. Must be unique.</td></tr><tr><td><code>known_good_version</code></td><td>The default version to initialize the tool at (required).</td></tr><tr><td><code>shims</code></td><td>A list of binaries exposed by the tool. Each of these will correspond to one identically named executable installed in <code>.trunk/tools.</code>In the most common case, there is exactly one shim matching the name of the tool. We'll discuss other cases below.</td></tr><tr><td><code>environment</code></td><td>You can specify an environment for the tool. We provide the <code>${tool}</code> template argument that resolves to the installation directory of the tool. By default, we prepend this to <code>$PATH</code> within the shim script, so this is used to locate the binary. For legacy reasons, <code>${linter}</code> also resolves to this directory.</td></tr></tbody></table>

> Note: If the tool has a `runtime` attribute, the runtime's environment is merged in to its environment (discussed in the examples below).

Broadly speaking, there are 3 kinds of tools - download, package, and runtime-based tools. We'll look at each one in turn:

#### Download-based tools

Download-based tools are straightforward: They reference a named download configuration in the global `downloads` section. Here is an example:

```yaml
downloads:
  - name: gh
    downloads:
      - os:
          linux: linux
        cpu:
          x86_64: amd64
          arm_64: arm64
        url: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v${version}/gh_${version}_${os}_${cpu}.tar.gz
        strip_components: 1
      - os:
          windows: windows
        cpu:
          x86_64: amd64
          arm_64: arm64
        url: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v${version}/gh_${version}_${os}_${cpu}.zip
        strip_components: 1
      # macOS releases since 2.28.0 started using .zip instead of .tar.gz
      - os:
          macos: macOS
        cpu:
          x86_64: amd64
          arm_64: arm64
        url: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v${version}/gh_${version}_${os}_${cpu}.zip
        strip_components: 1
        version: ">=2.28.0"
      - os:
          macos: macOS
        cpu:
          x86_64: amd64
          arm_64: arm64
        url: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v${version}/gh_${version}_${os}_${cpu}.tar.gz
        strip_components: 1
tools:
  definitions:
    - name: gh
      download: gh
      known_good_version: 2.27.0
      environment:
        - name: PATH
          list: ["${tool}/bin"]
      shims: [gh]
```

Note that for the downloaded archive, the binary named `gh` is inside the `bin` directory, so we use the environment to point the `$PATH` there.

#### Download fields

`strip_components`: This number of leading directory components to remove from all files in an archive when extracting.

`rename_single_file`: If an archive contains a single file, this will cause that file to be renamed to the name of the tool. This is most useful for downloads of gzip'd binaries with the platform name in the binary.

#### Package-based tools

Package-based tools depend on specified `package` and `runtime` attributes. Here is an example of configuring `mypy` as a tool:

```yaml
tools:
  definitions:
    - name: mypy
      runtime: python
      package: mypy
      shims: [mypy]
      known_good_version: 0.931
      extra_packages:
      	- types-six@1.16.21
        - types-request
```

`extra_packages` behaves equivalently to a package file like `requirements.txt` for Python or `package.json` for Node. They can be optionally pinned at versions.

The version of the primary package (in this case, `mypy`) is specified in the `tools.enabled`. So to enable the `mypy` tool at `1.4.0`, list it as `- mypy@1.4.0`.

If you don't want to include additional packages in the tool definition, you can instead make them explicit in the enabled section of your `.trunk/trunk.yaml` as you would for [linters](../../../code-quality/linters/), for example:

```yaml
tools:
  enabled:
    - mypy@1.4.0:
        packages:
          - types-six@1.16.21
```

#### Runtime-based tools

Runtime-based tools are a special case that are not explicitly defined. Rather, each runtime object exposes a set of `shims` (just like `tool` definitions).

If the runtime is enabled and listed in `tools.runtimes`, then shims exposed by that runtime are automatically installed in the `.trunk/tools` directory alongside those of other tools (`trunk tools enable <runtime_tool>` does that for you). Thus you can run `python`, `pip`, etc as `trunk`-managed tools.

Example:

```yaml
tools:
  runtimes:
    - python
```

If this is disruptive to your workflow, simply remove the runtime's name `(go, node, python,...)` from `tools.runtimes` section or run `trunk tools disable <runtime_name>` which will handle it for you. Runtimes cannot be enabled or versioned via the `tools.enabled` section, however, and runtimes must be enabled in the `runtimes` section to be available to have their shims installed.
