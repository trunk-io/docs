# Predictive Testing

The core concept of any merge queue solution is predictive testing. The idea here is to test your pull request against the head of your protected branch `main` and all the pull requests ahead of your own in the queue.  \

**What's the point of predictive testing?**

Normally pull requests are tested against a snapshot of the head of `main` when the pull request is posted to your source control provider. This can mean that by the time the pull request is actually merged - the results of the automated testing are stale. \
\
When you merge a pull request with stale results you are effectively merging in un-tested code. The changes to the protected branch since the test was run create a blind spot in your testing regimen. With predictive testing, you no longer have a blind spot because the merge queue ensures that the pull request is tested against the state of `main` that will exist when your pull request is merged. \
\
No blind spots === no build breakages.
