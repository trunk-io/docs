### Plans

#### **Free Plans**

Trunk offers a free plan to experiment with each of our features. Each feature has a free-tier limit; after exceeding this limit, we prompt you to upgrade to a paid subscription.

Similar to [calculating user counts](billing.md#calculating-user-counts), our free tier limits are calculated based on a 30-day rolling window.

<table><thead><tr><th width="155">Feature</th><th width="257">Metric</th><th>Free Tier Limit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>All</td><td>Users</td><td>5 commiters per month, unlimited on public repos</td></tr><tr><td>Code Quality</td><td>Quality &#x26; security metrics</td><td>Up to 100k issues uploaded</td></tr><tr><td>Merge Queue</td><td>PRs merged per month</td><td>100 PRs merged per month</td></tr><tr><td>Flaky Tests</td><td>Number of <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">test spans</a></td><td>5 committers and 5M test spans per month</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Data backfilling</td><td>Up to 30 days</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Team Plans

Trunk Team Plans offers a monthly subscription plan using a per-seat model. At the end of every billing period, we calculate the number of users using Trunk and update the next monthâ€™s invoice to reflect the latest user count. Each seat has access to all of Trunk's features.

<table><thead><tr><th width="155">Feature</th><th width="257">Metric</th><th>Limits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Code Quality</td><td>Quality &#x26; security metrics</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Merge Queue</td><td>PRs merged per month</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Flaky Tests</td><td>Number of <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">test spans</a></td><td><p>1 million test spans per seat per month.</p><p>$3 for each additional 1 million test spans.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### **Enterprise Plans**

Trunk Enterprise offers powerful admin controls, dedicated support, access to custom billing or terms, and features like SSO. If your team is interested in an enterprise plan, please contact [sales@trunk.io](mailto:sales@trunk.io).

**Trials**

You and your team can trial Trunk before signing up for an Enterprise or Team plan. To try Trunk, please contact [sales@trunk.io](mailto:sales@trunk.io). To extend or cancel the trial, please contact [sales@trunk.io](mailto:sales@trunk.io).

### Calculating User Counts

A user is a non-bot user who has made a commit to a private repo with Trunk enabled in the last 30 days. Specifically, we look at their username; if someone changes their username on Git, _we would consider that a separate user_. We do not count contributions to public (open source) repos. Contributor counts are displayed on **Settings** > **Billing**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Trunk requires the [Trunk GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/trunk-io) to be installed in your repo to count seats.
{% endhint %}

For example, consider Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all in the same organization, which owns two private repos: `abc/repo1` and `abc/repo2`. Given the following timeline of events:

| Day 1                              | Day 15                           | Day 22                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Alice commits code to `abc/repo1`. | Bob commits code to `abc/repo2`. | Charlie commits code to `abc/repo1`. |

On Day 1, the user count would be **one**: just Alice.\
On Day 15, the user count would be **two**: Alice and Bob, since the same organization owns both private repos.\
On Day 22, the user count would be **three**: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.\
On Day 30, the user count would be **three**. We consider days 1 through 30 (inclusive), which include Alice's, Bob's, and Charlie's commits.\
On Day 31, the user count would be **two**. We consider days 2 through 31 (inclusive), which only includes Bob's and Charlie's commits.

### Calculating an Invoice

At the end of every billing cycle, Trunk calculates what the next invoice should be. Trunk determines feature usage and the number of seats used over the [free tier usage limits](billing.md#free-plans-and-trials) . See our section on [calculating user counts](billing.md#calculating-user-counts) to determine how much we charge per feature usage.

### Editing Payment Details

You can edit your payment details by navigating to **Settings** > **Billing** and clicking on the pencil icon on the credit card. Trunk accepts both credit card and ACH; if you require a different payment method, please contact us at [sales@trunk.io](mailto:sales@trunk.io).

### Cancelling a Plan

You can cancel an active Trunk subscription by navigating to **Settings** > **Billing** and clicking the **Cancel Subscription** button. Your plan will transition back into the [free tier](billing.md#free-plans-and-trials); if you want to re-enable this plan, please contact us at [sales@trunk.io](mailto:sales@trunk.io).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Cancelling a Trunk Plan may result in a degraded product experience. Please contact us at [sales@trunk.io](mailto:sales@trunk.io) to re-enable any canceled plan.
{% endhint %}

### A Note on Security

Your security is important to us. We do not store your credit card information anywhere in our systems. Online payments are processed using Stripe, which is PCI-compliant in accordance with industry standards.
