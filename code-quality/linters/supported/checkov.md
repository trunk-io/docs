# Checkov

[**Checkov**](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) is a linter for Cloudformation, Security, Terraform and Docker.

You can enable the Checkov linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable checkov
```

## Auto Enabling

Checkov will be auto-enabled if any _Terraform, Cloudformation, Docker, Yaml or Json_ files are present.

## Settings

Checkov supports the following config files:

* `.checkov.yml`
* `.checkov.yaml`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linters](../configure-linters.md#moving-linters) for more info.
