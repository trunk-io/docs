# buf

[**buf**](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf#readme) is a linter for Protobuf.


buf is composed of several linter commands.
    
`buf-format` only runs the reformatting, not lint checking.

You can enable the `buf-format` linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable buf-format
```

`buf-lint` only runs the lint checking, not reformatting.

You can enable the `buf-lint` linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable buf-lint
```

`buf-breaking` only checks for breaking proto changes.

You can enable the `buf-breaking` linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable buf-breaking
```


## Auto Enabling

buf will never be auto-enabled. It must be enabled manually.

## Settings

buf supports the following config files:
* `buf.yaml`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linters](../configure-linters#moving-linters) for more info.
