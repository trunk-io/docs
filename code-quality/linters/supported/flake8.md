# Flake8

[**Flake8**](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is a linter for Python.

You can enable the Flake8 linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable flake8
```
![flake8 example output](./flake8.gif)
## Auto Enabling

Flake8 will be auto-enabled if a `.flake8` config file is present.

## Settings

Flake8 supports the following config files:
* `.flake8`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linter Configs](..#moving-linter-configs) for more info.
Trunk Code Quality provides a default `.flake8` if your project does not already have one.

## Usage Notes



Flake8 has a plugin architecture where if you install a plugin, it gets used. You can enable Flake8 plugins via:

```yaml
enabled:
  - flake8@3.9.2:
      packages:
        - flake8-bugbear@21.4.3
```
`flake8-bugbear` is probably the most popular **flake8** plugin, we recommend it!. Here are a few other popular flake8 plugins you should consider.

* **flake8-comprehensions**: Helps in identifying unnecessary comprehensions in your code.

* **flake8-docstrings**: Checks for compliance with Python docstring conventions.

* **flake8-import-order**: Checks the order of your imports according to various configurable ordering styles.

Here's an updated code snippet with the above Plugins enabled:

```undefined
enabled:
  - flake8@3.9.2:
      packages:
        - flake8-bugbear@21.4.3
        - flake8-docstrings@1.7.0
        - flake8-import-order@0.18.2
        - flake8-comprehensions@3.14.0
```
