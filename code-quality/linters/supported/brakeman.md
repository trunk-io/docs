# Brakeman

[**Brakeman**](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) is a linter for Ruby.

You can enable the Brakeman linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable brakeman
```

## Auto Enabling

Brakeman will be auto-enabled if any *Ruby* files are present.

## Settings

Brakeman supports the following config files:
* `brakeman.ignore`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linters](../configure-linters.md#moving-linters) for more info.
