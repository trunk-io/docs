# Ansible-lint

[**Ansible-lint**](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) is a linter for Ansible.

You can enable the Ansible-lint linter with:

```shell
trunk check enable ansible-lint
```

## Auto Enabling

Ansible-lint will never be auto-enabled. It must be enabled manually.

## Settings

Ansible-lint supports the following config files:
* `.ansible-lint`

You can move these files to `.trunk/configs` and `trunk check` will still find them. See [Moving Linter Configs](..#moving-linter-configs) for more info.


## Usage Notes

**Ansible-lint** must be configured with a trigger. See the [trigger rules](../#trigger-rules) documentation for more information.

If your ansible setup is not contained within a single folder you would list all files and directories belonging to your ansible setup.
