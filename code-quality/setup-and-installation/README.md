# Setup & Installation

Trunk Code Quality is easy to adopt for new and legacy projects alike. You can run Trunk Code Quality using your existing linter configurations, incrementally address existing problems, and prevent new issues from being committed to your repo.

You can start using Code Quality in your repos in 4 steps.

You can address problems up front, use <strong>hold-the-line</strong> to fix them incrementally, and configure ignores for irrelevant issues.     </td><td></td><td><a href="deal-with-existing-issues.md">deal-with-existing-issues.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Step 3: Prevent New Issues</strong></td><td>Set up automated runs on commits, before pushes, and on PRs to prevent new issues from appearing in your repo.</td><td></td><td><a href="prevent-new-issues.md">prevent-new-issues.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Step 4: Nightly Reports</strong></td><td>Code Standards evolve, and new vulnerabilities are discovered daily.
