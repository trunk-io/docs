# Compatibility

## Linux

Trunk will run on most Linux flavors, including Ubuntu, Arch, and others. We do require glibc version 2.19 or later. Alpine Linux is not supported.

## macOS

Trunk will run on macOS version 10.15 or later.

## Windows

[Currently in public beta.](windows-beta.md)

## Backward Compatibility

We generally strive to maintain backward compatibility between the [Trunk Launcher](../../reference/components.md#trunk-launcher) and the Trunk binary, but you may need to occasionally upgrade the launcher to support the newest version of Trunk.
