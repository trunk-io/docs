# Code Quality

{% hint style="warning" %}
Available as a CLI tool and VSCode extension, Code Quality is a separate from the Trunk Platform for CI Stability, which includes [Merge Queue](../../../broken-reference/) and [Flaky Tests](../../../broken-reference/). Code Quality runs entirely locally and does not require access to the Trunk web app or platform services.
{% endhint %}

Trunk Code Quality is a **metalinter** that lets you lint every language and every file in your project with a single tool using 100+ supported idiomatic code-checking tools, such as ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, and more for every language and project.

Trunk Code Quality is trusted by popular open-source projects like [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) to improve their developer experience. [Learn more about how ESLint leverages Code Quality in their repos](https://trunk.io/blog/improving-linting-experience-in-eslint-s-open-source-repo-with-trunk-code-quality).
