<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/check.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Trunk Code Quality is a **metalinter** that lets you lint every language and every file in your project with a single tool using 100+ supported idiomatic code-checking tools, such as ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, and more for every language and project.&#x20;

Trunk Code Quality is trusted by popular open-source projects like [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) to improve their developer experience. [Learn more about how ESLint leverages Code Quality in their repos](https://trunk.io/blog/improving-linting-experience-in-eslint-s-open-source-repo-with-trunk-code-quality).

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Trunk Code Quality is free for Open-Source.

Maintaining consistency in open-source repos is hard. That's why Trunk Code Quality is free for repos like [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), which leverages Code Quality to overcome linting challenges in their repos. [Learn more about pricing](https://trunk.io/pricing)
